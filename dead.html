                            has left due to retirement. The remaining reapers meet their new boss Cameron Kane, a "slick
                            business man who couldn't care less about helping the newly dead." George reconnects with
                            her sister Reggie when she has to reap the soul of Reggie's new (and secret) boyfriend,
                            Hudson Hart. Daisy (now played by Sarah Wynter) is attracted to Cameron, who helps her get a
                            role in After the Fall. Daisy, in a bid to gain the leading role, injures the lead actress
                            and due to the stress turns to alcohol, even during the performances.</p>
